# page-rank
A collection of problems for my Foundations of Data Science class to implement the page rank algorithm.

## Setup
Use pip to install any packages and dependencies

problem1~5.py - These are the files where I implemented the several functions for page rank. My code went in the "INSERT YOUR CODE" sections.

test1~5.py - These are the provided tests to run my implementation of pagerank. To run `test1.py1`:

`nosetests test1.py`
