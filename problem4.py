    Problem 4: Adding teleportation matrix into PageRank
    In this problem, we implement the pagerank algorithm which can solve the sink node problem with incorporating teleportation matrix.
    We will consider a random surfer model where a user has 2 options at every timestep: (option 1) randomly follow a link on the page or (option 2) randomly go to any page in the graph. 
    The probabilities are as follows:
        Randomly follow a link: alpha, for example, 0.95
        Randomly go to any page in the graph: (1 - alpha), for example, 0.05
    You could test the correctness of your code by typing `nosetests test4.py` in the terminal.

        compute the pagerank transition Matrix G from adjacency matrix A, which solves the sink node problem with incorporating teleportation matrix.
        G[j][i] represents the probability of moving from node i to node j.
        If node i is a sink node, S[j][i] = 1/n.
        Input: 
                A: adjacency matrix, a (n by n) numpy matrix of binary values. If there is a link from node i to node j, A[j][i] =1. Otherwise A[j][i]=0 if there is no link.
                alpha: a float scalar value, which is the probability of choosing option 1 (randomly follow a link on the page)
        Output: 
                G: the transition matrix, a (n by n) numpy matrix of float values.  G[j][i] represents the probability of moving from node i to node j.
    The values in each column of matrix G should sum to 1.
